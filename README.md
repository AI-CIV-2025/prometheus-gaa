# GAA System - Current Working Components

This document outlines the core components and functionalities currently implemented and verified within the GAA system.

## Core Modules

*   **Script Organization:** All executable scripts have been organized into the \`./data/scripts\` directory.
*   **Configuration Management:** Configuration files are stored in \`./data/configs\`.
*   **Documentation Hub:** All generated documentation, including script overviews and system analysis, resides in \`./data/docs\`.
*   **Logging:** System logs are captured in \`./data/logs\`.
*   **Testing Framework:** Unit and integration tests are located in \`./data/tests\`.
*   **Source Code:** Core application source code is in \`./data/src\`.

## Key Utilities

*   **System Analysis Script:** Located at \`./data/analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md\` (timestamped), provides insights into system state and execution.
*   **Execution Statistics Script:** Located at \`./data/stats.sh\`, provides a summary of file statistics and recent activity.

## Known Issues & Future Work

*   **YAML Parsing:** Ongoing efforts to refine YAML parsing robustness and error handling.
*   **API Efficiency:** Investigating and optimizing API interactions for performance gains.
*   **Error Handling:** Enhancing global error handling mechanisms for improved stability.
*   **Logging Improvements:** Implementing more granular and context-aware logging.

## System Stability

The system is being actively improved for stability. Regular documentation and script organization contribute to a more maintainable and reliable codebase.

## System Environment

*   **Execution Path:** All file operations are confined to \`./data\` as per policy.
*   **Allowed Commands:** Strict adherence to the defined system execution policy is maintained.
