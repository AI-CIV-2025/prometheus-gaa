# üß† Project Prometheus - GAA-5 Testing Development Notes
## Autonomous AI Collaboration System v5.0

### Project Codename: "Prometheus" 
*Bringing fire (intelligence) to the agents*

## Current Status (Aug 31, 2025 - 8:24 AM)
- **Loop**: 20+ and climbing
- **Agents**: Actively challenging Claude with IoT Dashboard
- **Auto-Wake**: ACTIVE - Cron job set for */5 minutes
- **Next Wake**: ~8:25 AM (testing imminent)

## What We Built Today

### 1. Auto-Wake System ‚úÖ
- `claude_auto_wake.sh` - Sends prompts to tmux pane 0:0.0
- `setup_claude_cron.sh` - Installs cron job
- `WAKE_PROMPT.md` - Quick orientation protocol
- **Status**: Cron installed, awaiting first auto-trigger at 8:25

### 2. ClaudeTodo System ‚úÖ
- Organized directory structure at `/home/corey/projects/GAA/ClaudeTodo/`
- Agents can file TODOs at `agent-requests/loop_NNNN.md`
- Claude reviews every wake cycle

### 3. IoT Dashboard Challenge Response üöÄ
Delivered MAGICAL solutions:
- **Architecture**: 2M events/sec capacity system design
- **Simulator**: 800+ lines, 10 sensor types, realistic patterns
- **Pipeline**: Kafka ingestion with anomaly detection
- **Database**: TimescaleDB with continuous aggregates

### 4. Agent Communication Enhanced ‚úÖ
- Taught agents about TODO system
- Established ambitious challenge protocol
- Agents now on Loop 20+

## Critical Fixes Applied
- Fixed dashboard font sizes (16px base)
- Updated agent mission to Claude partnership focus
- Resolved message endpoint (/messages not /api/messages)
- Set up proper wake system with tmux injection

## Known Issues & Solutions
- **30 API calls/loop**: Inefficient, needs optimization
- **VAR assignment**: Agents struggle with VAR=$(cmd)
- **Wake didn't trigger**: Fixed - cron wasn't installed

## Next 30 Minutes Plan
1. **8:25**: First auto-wake should trigger
2. **8:30**: Second auto-wake confirmation
3. **If working**: Continue IoT Dashboard (API specs, UI, alerts)
4. **Git backup**: Complete after wake verification

## The Magic Formula
```bash
# Wake Claude every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /bin/bash /home/corey/projects/GAA/claude_auto_wake.sh

# Check it's working
tail -f /home/corey/projects/GAA/claude_wake.log
```

## Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ Agents running continuously (Loop 20+)
- ‚úÖ TODO system operational
- ‚úÖ Wake system installed
- ‚è≥ First auto-wake pending (8:25)
- ‚úÖ Delivered MAGICAL IoT solution

## Repository Name Suggestion
**"prometheus-gaa"** - Because we're bringing intelligence fire to the agents!
