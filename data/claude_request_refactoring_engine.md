# Request to Claude Code: Design and Implementation of an Advanced AI-Powered Code Refactoring Engine (ARC-Engine)

## Introduction
We are embarking on an ambitious project to develop an "Advanced AI-Powered Code Refactoring Engine" (ARC-Engine). This engine aims to automate and streamline complex code refactoring tasks, improving code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity. We require your expertise to design and implement the core components of this engine, focusing initially on Python.

## Project Overview
The ARC-Engine will be a modular, extensible system that operates on Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to perform intelligent code transformations. It will feature a plugin system for adding new refactoring rules and language support, along with a command-line interface.

## Detailed Requirements & Deliverables

### 1. Core Engine (Python)
*   **AST Parsing & Manipulation**: Implement robust Python AST parsing, traversal, and modification capabilities. This should allow for identifying nodes, replacing subtrees, and inserting new code structures.
*   **Refactoring Rule Definition Framework**: Design and implement a clear, declarative (or programmatic) framework for defining refactoring rules. This framework should be easily extendable.
*   **Core Refactoring Logic**: Implement the mechanism to apply defined rules to the parsed AST and generate modified code.
*   **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for parsing failures, invalid rules, or transformation conflicts.

### 2. Initial Refactoring Rule Set (Python)
Implement at least three common Python refactoring rules using the framework:
*   **Extract Method**: Identify a block of code and refactor it into a new function/method.
*   **Rename Variable/Function**: Safely rename a variable or function, updating all references within scope.
*   **Introduce Parameter Object**: Replace a long list of parameters with a new data class/object.

### 3. Plugin System
*   **Architecture**: Design a plugin system that allows external modules to register new refactoring rules or even new language parsers (though only Python is required initially).
*   **Loading Mechanism**: A simple mechanism to discover and load plugins from a specified directory.

### 4. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
*   **Basic Usage**: A CLI tool to specify a file/directory, select a refactoring rule, and apply it.
*   **Preview Mode**: Option to show a diff of changes before applying them.
*   **Rule Listing**: Command to list all available refactoring rules.

### 5. Test Suite
*   **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all core engine components, AST manipulation utilities, and individual refactoring rules.
*   **Integration Tests**: Tests that simulate end-to-end refactoring scenarios using the CLI.

### 6. Documentation Suite
*   **README.md**: A comprehensive README detailing project setup, installation, basic usage, and examples.
*   **API Documentation**: Auto-generated (if possible) or manually written API documentation for core components and the refactoring rule framework.
*   **Architectural Overview**: Document the overall design, plugin system, and key design decisions.
*   **Refactoring Rule Guides**: Documentation for each implemented refactoring rule, including its purpose, parameters, and examples.

## Technology Stack
*   **Primary Language**: Python 3.9+
*   **AST Library**: Python's built-in `ast` module (or a recommended alternative if significantly better for mutation).
*   **CLI Framework**: `argparse` or `click` (developer's choice).
*   **Testing Framework**: `pytest`.

## Deliverables Summary
*   A multi-file Python codebase structured logically (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`).
*   `README.md`
*   All specified refactoring rules implemented.
*   Comprehensive test suite.
*   Full documentation suite.
*   A sample `requirements.txt` file.

We anticipate an iterative process and look forward to your innovative solutions.
