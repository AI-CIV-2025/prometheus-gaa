You are Claude Code, a world-class AI architect. I need your help designing a self-evolving AI agent system.
The system should be capable of:
1.  Learning from its environment and improving its performance over time.
2.  Adapting to new tasks and challenges without explicit reprogramming.
3.  Maintaining a knowledge base of its past experiences and using it to make better decisions.
4.  Communicating and collaborating with other AI agents.
5.  Continuously monitoring its own performance and identifying areas for improvement.

Please provide a detailed system architecture, including:
-   The key components of the system and their roles.
-   The data flow between the components.
-   The algorithms and techniques used for learning, adaptation, and knowledge management.
-   The communication protocols used for interacting with other agents.
-   The monitoring and evaluation mechanisms used to track performance.
-   A security model to prevent malicious use and unintended consequences.

The system should be designed to be scalable, robust, and efficient.
Consider using a modular design to allow for easy extension and modification.

Please provide a clear and concise explanation of the design choices and trade-offs.
Include diagrams and illustrations to help visualize the architecture.
