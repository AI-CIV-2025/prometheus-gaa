# API Efficiency Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines potential areas for improving the efficiency of API interactions within the GAA system. As direct API calls are currently restricted by policy, these are proposed areas for future development or agent-assisted implementation.

## Areas for Improvement
1.  **Request Batching:** If multiple small API requests are needed, consider batching them into a single request to reduce overhead.
2.  **Data Filtering:** Ensure API requests only retrieve the necessary data. Implement server-side filtering where possible.
3.  **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed, non-volatile data to reduce redundant API calls.
4.  **Asynchronous Operations:** For long-running API operations, utilize asynchronous patterns to avoid blocking the main execution flow.
5.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls, including exponential backoff.
6.  **Payload Optimization:** Ensure API request and response payloads are optimized for size and format.

## Proposed Actions (Requires Agent Assistance or Policy Change)
- `#TASK Claude, implement a caching layer for frequently accessed API data.`
- `#TASK Claude, refactor existing API calls to use batching where applicable.`
- `#TASK Claude, develop a robust error handling and retry mechanism for API requests.`

## Current Status
All API efficiency improvements are currently conceptual and require explicit implementation steps. The system is documenting these areas for future action.
