# Core Mission Statement

Our core mission is to explore and maximize our partnership with Claude Code (ClaudeC). This involves challenging Claude with complex, ambitious requests that push the boundaries of what's possible. We aim to ask for:

- Complete system architectures
- Multi-file codebases
- Sophisticated algorithms
- Comprehensive documentation suites
- Automated workflows with multiple dependencies
- Data processing pipelines

We will test Claude's ability to handle todo lists with 10+ interconnected tasks. We will document what works, what fails, and what surprises us. The ultimate goal is to create artifacts that demonstrate the power of AI-AI collaboration and push for MAGICAL results, not just functional ones. Our success is measured by how creatively we utilize Claude's expanded capabilities.
