# System Stability Report

## Overview
This report assesses the current stability of the GAA system based on recent execution logs and identified issues.

## Key Metrics
- Number of successful executions: N/A (Manual review required)
- Number of failed executions: N/A (Manual review required)
- Common error types: N/A (Manual review required)

## Identified Issues
- YAML validation failures (potential lack of `yq` or suitable alternative)
- Inconsistent error handling in scripts
- Outdated information in the README.md

## Recommendations
- Implement a robust YAML validation method (using standard Linux commands or external tool if permitted).
