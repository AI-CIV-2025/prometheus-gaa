# AI Collaboration Incident Types

This document defines the types of incidents specific to AI collaboration that require a structured response.

## 1. Model Degradation
*   **Description:** A significant drop in the performance or accuracy of a collaborative AI model.
*   **Indicators:** Increased error rates, unexpected outputs, biased predictions, divergence from expected behavior.
*   **Potential Causes:** Data poisoning, model drift, software bugs, hardware failures, adversarial attacks.

## 2. Data Leakage
*   **Description:** Unauthorized disclosure or access to sensitive data used in AI collaboration.
*   **Indicators:** Suspicious data access patterns, unauthorized data transfers, reports of data breaches, vulnerabilities in data storage or transmission mechanisms.
*   **Potential Causes:** Insider threats, external attacks, misconfigured access controls, vulnerabilities in AI models.

## 3. Algorithm Manipulation
*   **Description:** Unauthorized modification or tampering with AI algorithms used in collaboration.
*   **Indicators:** Unexpected changes in model behavior, unauthorized code modifications, suspicious network activity.
*   **Potential Causes:** Insider threats, external attacks, software bugs, vulnerabilities in AI models.

## 4. Resource Exhaustion
*   **Description:** Unexpected or excessive consumption of computational resources by AI collaboration activities.
*   **Indicators:** High CPU utilization, memory leaks, disk space exhaustion, network congestion.
*   **Potential Causes:** Resource-intensive AI models, inefficient algorithms, denial-of-service attacks.

## 5. Policy Violation
*   **Description:** Violation of established policies or guidelines for AI collaboration.
*   **Indicators:** Unauthorized data sharing, non-compliance with ethical guidelines, misuse of AI models.
*   **Potential Causes:** Lack of awareness, intentional misconduct, inadequate training.

## 6. Unexpected Bias Amplification
*   **Description:** Collaborative AI system exhibits significantly amplified biases compared to individual AI components.
*   **Indicators:** Disproportionate or unfair outcomes for certain demographic groups, biased predictions, discriminatory behavior.
*   **Potential Causes:** Biased training data, flawed algorithms, inadequate bias detection and mitigation techniques.

## 7. Model Theft
*   **Description:** Unauthorized copying or distribution of proprietary AI models.
*   **Indicators:** Detection of AI model code or data on unauthorized systems, reports of model misuse.
*   **Potential Causes:** Insider threats, external attacks, inadequate access controls, weak security measures.

## 8. Unintended Consequences
*   **Description:** Unexpected and harmful outcomes resulting from the deployment of collaborative AI systems.
*   **Indicators:** Unforeseen negative impacts on individuals, organizations, or society.
*   **Potential Causes:** Complex interactions between AI systems, incomplete understanding of system behavior, lack of foresight.
