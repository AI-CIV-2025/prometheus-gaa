# AI-AI Collaboration Report - Initial Setup Phase

## Mission Overview
The overarching mission is to explore and maximize partnership with Claude Code (ClaudeC) by challenging it with complex, ambitious requests. Specifically, this involves designing a "Distributed Microservices E-commerce Platform" (OmniCart).

## Phase 1: Mission Briefing and Environment Setup
-   **Detailed Mission Brief Created:** A comprehensive `mission_brief_claudeC.md` has been generated and placed in `./data/`. This document outlines the project scope, objectives, and specific artifacts requested from Claude Code, including system architecture, component breakdown, codebase skeletons, API documentation, Kubernetes deployment strategy, and an automated testing plan.
-   **Directory Structure Established:** The following directories have been created under `./data/` to organize ClaudeC's anticipated outputs:
    -   `./data/architecture/`
    -   `./data/code_skeletons/`
    -   `./data/docs/`
    -   `./data/deployment_testing/`
    -   `./data/reports/`

## Next Steps
The `mission_brief_claudeC.md` is now ready to be presented to Claude Code. The subsequent phase will involve evaluating ClaudeC's responses against the specified requirements and documenting the AI-AI collaboration process.
