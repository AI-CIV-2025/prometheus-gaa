# Serverless Real-time Data Processing Pipeline Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the proposed serverless architecture for a real-time data processing pipeline. The design leverages AWS serverless services to ensure scalability, cost-efficiency, and high availability.

## Components

### 1. IoT Device Data Source
*   **Description**: Simulated IoT devices generating telemetry data in JSON format.
*   **Role**: Origin of raw data.

### 2. AWS API Gateway (Ingestion Endpoint)
*   **Description**: A fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
*   **Role**: Acts as the initial entry point for IoT data, providing a secure and scalable HTTP endpoint.

### 3. AWS Lambda (Ingestion Function - `lambda_ingest`)
*   **Description**: A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.
*   **Role**: Receives data from API Gateway, performs basic validation, and publishes it to an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream.

### 4. Amazon Kinesis Data Stream
*   **Description**: A real-time data streaming service capable of continuously capturing gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources.
*   **Role**: Provides a durable, ordered, and scalable buffer for incoming raw data, decoupling ingestion from processing.

### 5. AWS Lambda (Processing Function - `lambda_process`)
*   **Description**: Triggered by new records in the Kinesis Data Stream.
*   **Role**: Reads data from Kinesis, performs transformations (e.g., data cleansing, enrichment), aggregations (e.g., hourly averages), and prepares it for storage.

### 6. Amazon DynamoDB (Processed Data Store)
*   **Description**: A fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit-millisecond latency at any scale.
*   **Role**: Stores the processed and aggregated data, optimized for quick retrieval for analytical queries.

### 7. AWS API Gateway (Analytics API)
*   **Description**: Exposes a RESTful API for querying the processed data.
*   **Role**: Provides a secure and scalable interface for external applications to retrieve insights.

### 8. AWS Lambda (Analytics API Function - `lambda_analytics`)
*   **Description**: Backend for the Analytics API Gateway.
*   **Role**: Queries DynamoDB based on request parameters and returns aggregated data or specific records.

### 9. Amazon CloudWatch (Monitoring & Logging)
*   **Description**: A monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources.
*   **Role**: Collects logs from Lambda functions and API Gateway, provides metrics for performance monitoring and alarms.

## Data Flow
1.  **IoT Devices** send data to **API Gateway (Ingestion)**.
2.  **API Gateway** invokes **Lambda (Ingestion)**.
3.  **Lambda (Ingestion)** publishes data to **Kinesis Data Stream**.
4.  **Kinesis Data Stream** triggers **Lambda (Processing)**.
5.  **Lambda (Processing)** processes data and stores it in **DynamoDB**.
6.  External clients query **API Gateway (Analytics)**.
7.  **API Gateway (Analytics)** invokes **Lambda (Analytics)**.
8.  **Lambda (Analytics)** retrieves data from **DynamoDB** and returns it to the client.
9.  All Lambda functions and API Gateway publish logs and metrics to **CloudWatch**.

## Future Enhancements (beyond initial scope)
*   Integration with Amazon S3 for raw data archiving and cold storage.
*   Leveraging Amazon Athena for ad-hoc querying of S3 data.
*   Implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
