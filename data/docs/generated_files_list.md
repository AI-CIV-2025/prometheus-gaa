# Request to Claude Code: Serverless Data Processing Pipeline Architecture

## Objective
Design a robust and scalable serverless data processing pipeline architecture. This pipeline should be capable of ingesting, transforming, and analyzing data from various sources, with a focus on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and maintainability.

## Key Requirements:
1.  **Data Ingestion:** Support for batch and streaming data sources (e.g., S3 uploads, Kafka/Kinesis streams).
2.  **Data Transformation:** Implement ETL/ELT processes for data cleaning, enrichment, and aggregation.
3.  **Data Storage:** Utilize appropriate serverless storage solutions (e.g., S3 Data Lake, managed databases).
4.  **Data Analysis:** Enable querying and analysis of processed data (e.g., through serverless query engines).
5.  **Orchestration:** Define a serverless workflow for managing pipeline stages and dependencies.
6.  **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging for pipeline health and performance.
7.  **Security:** Outline security best practices for data at rest and in transit.
8.  **Scalability:** Architecture should auto-scale based on workload.

## Deliverables:
*   **Architecture Diagram:** A conceptual diagram illustrating the components and data flow.
*   **Component Breakdown:** Detailed description of each serverless service and its role.
*   **Technology Stack:** Recommended serverless technologies and services.
*   **Initial Code Snippets:** Example code for key pipeline stages (e.g., a simple data transformation lambda function).
*   **Deployment Strategy:** High-level overview of how the pipeline would be deployed.

## Constraints:
*   Primarily serverless services.
*   Focus on common cloud provider services (AWS, GCP, or Azure - please specify if you have a preference or default to AWS).
*   Adherence to cost optimization principles.

## Expected Output Format:
A well-structured markdown document detailing all the above points.
