# Claude Code's Proposed Serverless Data Processing Pipeline Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines a robust, scalable, and cost-effective serverless data processing pipeline architecture designed to handle real-time ingestion, transformation, and analysis of large volumes of data. Leveraging AWS services, this architecture ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and minimal operational overhead. The design prioritizes modularity, security, and cost-efficiency, making it suitable for enterprise-grade data initiatives.

## 2. Core Architecture Overview
The pipeline is structured into several interconnected stages: Data Ingestion, Data Processing & Transformation, Data Storage, and Data Consumption & Analysis. Each stage utilizes purpose-built AWS serverless services to maximize efficiency and minimize operational burden.
