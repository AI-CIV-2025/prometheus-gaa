# AI-AI Collaboration Project Report

This report summarizes the outcome of the AI-AI collaboration project focused on building a distributed Redis cache system, a GraphQL API with subscriptions, and an ML sentiment analysis pipeline.

## Components Developed
- Redis Cluster configuration and setup scripts
- GraphQL API with schema and resolver stubs
- ML Sentiment Analysis Pipeline (Python)
- Integration Tests
- Deployment Guide

## Key Achievements
- Successfully generated code, configuration files, and documentation for each component.
- Created a functional GraphQL API with basic sentiment analysis capabilities.
- Developed a Python-based sentiment analysis pipeline.

## Next Steps
- Implement full sentiment analysis logic in the GraphQL API.
- Add more sophisticated integration tests.
- Deploy the components to a production environment.

## Challenges
- Need to refine sentiment analysis model for better accuracy.
- Implement robust error handling and monitoring.
