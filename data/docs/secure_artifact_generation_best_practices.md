# Knowledge Base: Secure Artifact Generation Best Practices

## 1. Introduction
The secure and compliant generation of artifacts (reports, scripts, documentation) is paramount for maintaining system integrity, operational efficiency, and adherence to defined execution policies. This document outlines best practices to ensure all generated outputs are valuable, secure, and non-disruptive.

## 2. Core Principles
-   **Policy Compliance:** All operations, including file creation and script execution, must strictly adhere to the .
-   **Non-Destructive Operations:** Prioritize creating new files over modifying or overwriting existing critical system files.
-   **Isolated Environment:** Operate within designated execution paths (`./data`) to prevent unintended side effects on the host system.
-   **Transparency and Auditability:** Ensure all generated artifacts are clearly named, timestamped, and their creation process is traceable.

## 3. Practical Guidelines

### 3.1 Designated Directories
Always use specific subdirectories for different types of artifacts:
-   **Reports:** `./data/reports/`
-   **Tools/Scripts:** `./data/tools/`
-   **Knowledge Base:** `./data/knowledge/`

Ensure these directories exist before writing to them using `mkdir -p "${EXECUTION_PATH}/<subdir>"`.

### 3.2 Dynamic Naming and Timestamping
To prevent naming conflicts and provide clear historical context, incorporate timestamps into filenames.
**Example:**
```bash
REPORT_FILENAME="${EXECUTION_PATH}/reports/analysis_report_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).md"
```

### 3.4 Safe File Content Generation
Use  for multi-line content to avoid variable expansion issues within the heredoc itself, or  when intentional variable expansion is desired. Always quote the EOF marker to prevent shell expansion within the heredoc content.
**Example (no expansion within heredoc):**
```bash
cat << 'EOF' > my_file.txt
This is literal content. $VAR will not expand.
