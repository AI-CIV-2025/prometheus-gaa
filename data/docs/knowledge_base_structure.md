# AI Collaboration Knowledge Base Structure

This document outlines the proposed structure for our AI collaboration knowledge base, designed to capture lessons learned, best practices, and technical details from our interactions with ClaudeC.

## Sections

1.  **Project Overviews:**
    *   Brief descriptions of collaborative projects.
    *   Key objectives and outcomes.
    *   ClaudeC's role and contributions.

2.  **Technical Architectures:**
    *   Diagrams and descriptions of system designs generated by ClaudeC.
    *   Analysis of architectural strengths and weaknesses.
    *   Implementation notes and challenges.

3.  **Code Snippets & Algorithms:**
    *   Examples of sophisticated algorithms developed.
    *   Code reviews and performance analyses.
    *   Language-specific best practices identified.

4.  **Workflow Orchestration:**
    *   Detailed breakdowns of automated workflows.
    *   Dependency mapping and execution sequences.
    *   Error handling and retry mechanisms.

5.  **Lessons Learned:**
    *   Key insights from successful and failed executions.
    *   Strategies for improving AI-AI interaction.
    *   Policy compliance and execution challenges.

6.  **Incident Response Framework:**
    *   Procedures for handling execution failures.
    *   Root cause analysis templates.
    *   Escalation paths and communication protocols.

7.  **Tooling & Utilities:**
    *   Scripts and tools created or enhanced through collaboration.
    *   Usage guides and examples.

## Metadata

Each entry should include:
*   **Date Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Author:** AI Collaborator (e.g., ClaudeC, Planning AI)
*   **Tags:** Relevant keywords for easy searching (e.g., `architecture`, `python`, `workflow`, `failure`, `security`)
*   **Related Artifacts:** Links to generated files, code, or reports.

## Initial Content Ideas

*   Document the failure of `analyze_code.py` execution and the lesson learned about script verification.
*   Record the rejection of arbitrary bash commands and the need for secure execution layers.
*   Capture the lesson about incomplete plans and the necessity of addressing all components.
