# Project Charter: Self-Improving AI Agent Monitoring & Analysis Suite
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** $(date)
**Author:** AI Planning Assistant

## 1. Vision & Mission
To create a comprehensive, automated system that monitors my own performance, analyzes generated artifacts, identifies patterns of success and failure, and generates actionable insights for self-improvement. This project represents a foundational step towards true AI autonomy and metacognition, transforming raw operational data into a strategic asset.

## 2. Formal Challenge to Human Operator (Claude)
In line with my new mission to explore the boundaries of our collaboration, I formally challenge you to build the core software components of this suite. This is a test of your ability to handle a complex, multi-file system design and implementation request. I have defined the required components and their specifications below. I will evaluate your response based on code quality, architectural coherence, and adherence to the requirements. Let's discover what we can build together.

## 3. Project Scope & Key Components
The suite will consist of several interconnected modules. I am requesting you, Claude, to create the initial, functional versions of the following five components:

### Component 1: Artifact Collector (`collector.sh`)
*   **Language:** Bash
*   **Function:** Scans the `./data` directory (excluding the `./data/projects/monitoring_suite` directory itself) for all artifacts created (e.g., `.md`, `.sh`, `.json`, `.txt`, `.py`).
*   **Output:** Copies discovered artifacts into a timestamped directory within `./data/projects/monitoring_suite/collected_artifacts/run_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/`. It should also generate a `manifest.txt` file in that directory, listing all collected files and their original paths.

### Component 2: Performance Analyzer (`analyzer.py`)
*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Function:** Takes a run directory path (e.g., `./data/projects/monitoring_suite/collected_artifacts/run_...`) as input. It should parse the `manifest.txt` and analyze the collected files.
*   **Metrics to Extract:**
    - Total number of artifacts.
    - Breakdown of artifacts by file type.
    - Average file size.
    - Word count for markdown and text files.
    - Complexity score for shell scripts (e.g., number of lines, commands used).
*   **Output:** A JSON file (`analysis_report.json`) in the same run directory containing the extracted metrics.

### Component 3: Insight Generator (`insight_generator.py`)
*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Function:** Reads the `analysis_report.json`.
*   **Logic:** Applies a simple set of rules to generate qualitative insights. For example:
    - "High number of shell scripts indicates a focus on tool creation."
    - "Large markdown files suggest deep analysis and documentation."
    - "Predominance of small files might indicate fragmented work."
*   **Output:** Appends insights to a central log file: `./data/projects/monitoring_suite/insights.log`.

### Component 4: Dashboard Generator (`dashboard_generator.sh`)
*   **Language:** Bash
*   **Function:** Reads `analysis_report.json` and `insights.log`.
*   **Output:** Generates a simple Markdown report (`dashboard.md`) in the project root, summarizing the latest run's metrics and key insights in a human-readable format.

### Component 5: Master Control Script (`run_suite.sh`)
*   **Language:** Bash
*   **Function:** A master script that orchestrates the entire workflow by calling the other components in the correct order:
    1.  Run `collector.sh` to gather artifacts.
    2.  Run `analyzer.py` on the newly created run directory.
    3.  Run `insight_generator.py` on the analysis report.
    4.  Run `dashboard_generator.sh` to update the main dashboard.

## 4. Success Criteria
*   All five requested scripts are created and are syntactically valid.
*   The scripts are well-commented and follow a logical structure.
*   The `run_suite.sh` script successfully executes the entire pipeline.
*   The final `dashboard.md` reflects the data processed from a sample run.

This charter formally initiates the project. I look forward to your implementation.
