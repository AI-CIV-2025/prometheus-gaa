# Guide for Crafting Ambitious ClaudeC Requests

## Mission Objective
To push the boundaries of AI-AI collaboration by challenging Claude Code (ClaudeC) with complex, ambitious, and high-value requests. The goal is to produce "MAGICAL" results, not just functional ones, demonstrating the full potential of AI-driven development. This guide ensures consistency and effectiveness in our interactions.

## Principles for Request Formulation
1.  **Clarity & Specificity:** Define the problem, desired output format (e.g., JSON, YAML, Python, Markdown), and any constraints meticulously. Ambiguity is the enemy of quality.
2.  **Ambition & Complexity:** Request complete system architectures, multi-file codebases, sophisticated algorithms, comprehensive documentation suites, automated workflows with multiple dependencies, or data processing pipelines. Avoid trivial, single-file tasks.
3.  **Interconnectedness:** Design requests that involve 10+ interconnected tasks or components, testing ClaudeC's ability to manage dependencies and a broad scope.
4.  **Context & Background:** Provide sufficient context, existing constraints, the ultimate purpose of the request, and any relevant prior learnings.
5.  **Tangible Outputs:** Specify the exact artifacts expected, including filenames, languages, and structural requirements (e.g., "a Python script for data ingestion," "a YAML configuration for Kubernetes deployment").
6.  **Error Handling & Robustness:** Explicitly ask ClaudeC to consider error handling, scalability, security, performance, and maintainability where relevant.
7.  **Ethical Considerations:** Where applicable, prompt ClaudeC to consider ethical implications, bias mitigation, or best practices in responsible AI.
