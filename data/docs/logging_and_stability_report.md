# System Stability and Logging Improvements Report

## Overview
This report details the recent enhancements made to the GAA system to improve its stability and logging capabilities. The primary goal was to create a more robust and observable system by implementing standardized error logging and improving the resilience of core scripts.

## Implemented Logging Mechanism
A centralized error logging script, \`./data/scripts/utils/log_error.sh\`, has been developed. This script:
- Records timestamped error messages.
- Includes the name of the script that generated the error.
- Stores logs in a dedicated \`./data/logs/error.log\` file.
- Provides a standardized format for all error reporting.

## Enhanced Script Resilience
The \`./data/scripts/analysis/monitor_system.sh\` script has been updated to demonstrate improved error handling:
- It gracefully handles scenarios where expected files might be missing using \`ls\` and redirecting stderr.
- It catches arithmetic errors using \`expr\` and checks the exit status.
- In both cases, the \`log_error.sh\` script is invoked to record the issue, allowing the script to continue execution where possible.
- Activity logs are maintained in \`./data/logs/activity.log\` for tracking script execution flow.

## Impact on System Stability
By implementing these logging and error handling measures, the system is expected to:
1. **Improve Debugging**: Errors are now consistently recorded, making it easier to identify and diagnose issues.
2. **Enhance Observability**: Activity logs provide insight into the execution flow of scripts.
3. **Increase Resilience**: Scripts are designed to handle common failure points more gracefully, preventing abrupt terminations.
4. **Centralize Information**: All critical error information is consolidated in a single location.

## Recommendations for Future Work
- Integrate \`log_error.sh\` into all existing and new scripts within the GAA system.
- Develop automated alerts based on the contents of \`./data/logs/error.log\`.
- Conduct further testing to identify and mitigate other potential failure points.
- Explore the use of \`journalctl\` or similar system logging tools if the environment permits and enhances observability further.
