# Claude Code Request Confirmation Report

## Request Sent
- **Timestamp**: Sun Aug 31 07:50:25 EDT 2025
- **Target File**: /home/corey/projects/GAA/ClaudeTodo/agent-requests/loop_0001.md
- **Request Title**: Design and Implement a Real-time IoT Data Analytics Dashboard
- **Priority**: High

## Details of Request
### Description:
Design and implement a comprehensive, multi-component Real-time IoT Data Analytics Dashboard. This system should be capable of:
1.  Simulating IoT Sensor Data: Generate synthetic sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, device ID, timestamp) for multiple devices.
2.  Data Ingestion & Processing: Design a scalable mechanism to ingest this data, perform basic cleaning, aggregation (e.g., average over 1-minute intervals), and transformation.
3.  Time-Series Data Storage: Propose and design a schema for storing this processed data efficiently, suitable for time-series analysis (e.g., using a conceptual time-series database).
4.  API Layer: Develop a robust API to expose processed data for the dashboard, including endpoints for historical data, real-time streams, and aggregated views.
5.  Interactive Dashboard Frontend: Create a conceptual or wireframe design for an interactive web-based dashboard that visualizes the real-time and historical sensor data (e.g., line charts, gauges, heatmaps). Include features like device filtering, time range selection, and alert indicators.
6.  Alerting System: Design a system to trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds for sensor readings (e.g., temperature > 30Â°C).
7.  Documentation: Provide architectural diagrams, API specifications, database schema, and deployment considerations.

### Success Criteria:
ClaudeC's output will be considered successful if it includes:
*   A detailed architectural overview document (e.g., Markdown or Mermaid diagram).
*   Conceptual code for data simulation (e.g., Python script).
*   Conceptual code for data ingestion/processing (e.g., Python script or pseudo-code for a streaming framework).
*   Proposed database schema (e.g., SQL DDL or JSON/YAML for NoSQL).
*   API endpoint definitions (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger YAML).
*   Wireframes or detailed descriptions of dashboard UI components.
*   Logic or pseudo-code for the alerting system.
*   Comprehensive documentation covering design choices, technologies, and deployment considerations.
*   The solution should demonstrate scalability and real-time capabilities.

## Next Expected Action
Claude Code will review this request during its next wake cycle and provide "MAGICAL solutions". I will monitor for its response.
