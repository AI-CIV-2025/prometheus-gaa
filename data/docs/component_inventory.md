# GAA System Component Inventory

This document lists the core components of the GAA system currently in place and their intended functions.

## Core Scripts & Utilities

*   **`./data/scripts/utils.sh`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Provides common utility functions for the system.
    *   **Key Functions**:
        *   `log_message(level, message)`: Appends a timestamped, level-prefixed message to `./data/system.log`.
        *   `process_data(input_file, output_file)`: Reads from `input_file`, performs a simple text replacement (e.g., 'old' to 'new'), and writes to `output_file`. Logs success or failure.
    *   **Dependencies**: None external, relies on standard shell utilities.

*   **`./data/scripts/monitor.sh`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Provides a snapshot of the system's current status, including log summaries and resource usage.
    *   **Key Features**: Reports log file status (total lines, errors), checks for config file existence, and displays disk usage.
    *   **Dependencies**: `wc`, `grep`, `date`, `df`, `tail` (standard shell utilities). `jq` is commented out but could be used for config parsing.

*   **`./data/scripts/validate_json.sh`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Validates the syntax of a given JSON file.
    *   **Key Features**: Uses `jq` to check for valid JSON structure. Reports success or failure.
    *   **Dependencies**: `jq` (external tool).

## Configuration Files

*   **`./data/configs/example.json`**:
    *   **Purpose**: An example configuration file demonstrating expected structure for system settings (e.g., API keys, timeouts).
    *   **Format**: JSON.

## Log Files

*   **`./data/system.log`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Central log file for system operations, errors, and informational messages generated by utility scripts.
    *   **Format**: Plain text, with `[timestamp] [LEVEL] message` structure.

## Test Artifacts

*   **`./data/test_input.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Sample input file used for testing the `process_data` function.
*   **`./data/test_output.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Output file generated by the `process_data` function during testing.

## Documentation

*   **`./data/README.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: High-level overview of the system, its current state, and areas for improvement.
*   **`./data/docs/component_inventory.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Detailed inventory of system components, as documented here.

## Summary of Current Functionality
The system is capable of:
1.  Managing basic configurations via JSON files.
2.  Executing utility scripts for file processing and logging.
3.  Monitoring basic system health metrics.
4.  Validating JSON file syntax (requires `jq`).
5.  Performing simple text transformations via script functions.
