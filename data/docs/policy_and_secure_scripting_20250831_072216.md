# Policy Compliance and Secure Scripting Best Practices for GAA-4.0

## Introduction
Operating within the GAA-4.0 environment requires strict adherence to defined execution policies and secure coding practices. This document outlines key best practices derived from operational experience and system feedback, focusing on command substitution, file path management, and general script development.
