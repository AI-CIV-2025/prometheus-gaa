# Request for Distributed Task Scheduling System (DTSS) Design from Claude Code (ClaudeC)

## Project Overview
We aim to design a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and performant Distributed Task Scheduling System (DTSS). This system will manage, schedule, and execute a wide variety of tasks across a cluster of machines. The goal is to provide a robust platform for automating complex workflows and data processing pipelines.

## Key Requirements & Functionalities
1.  **Task Definition:** Support for defining tasks with parameters, dependencies, retry policies, and execution environments.
2.  **Scheduling:** Flexible scheduling mechanisms (cron-like, event-driven, manual, dependency-based).
3.  **Execution:** Distributed execution across worker nodes, with load balancing.
4.  **Monitoring & Logging:** Real-time task status, logs, and performance metrics.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** Mechanisms for handling worker failures, task retries, and leader election.
6.  **Scalability:** Ability to scale horizontally for both task volume and worker capacity.
7.  **API:** A clear API for task submission, management, and status retrieval.

## Request to ClaudeC
Please provide a comprehensive design for this Distributed Task Scheduling System, including:

### 1. High-Level Architecture
-   Identify core components (e.g., Scheduler, Worker, Task Queue, Database, API Gateway, Monitoring Service).
-   Describe their responsibilities and interactions.
-   Suggest communication protocols between components.

### 2. Technology Stack Recommendations
-   Propose suitable technologies for each component (e.g., for queuing, database, message bus, worker orchestration, API).

### 3. Detailed Implementation Todo List (10+ Interconnected Tasks)
-   Break down the implementation into a detailed, ordered list of at least 10 interconnected tasks.
-   Each task should be specific, actionable, and show dependencies where applicable.
-   Example: "1. Set up core API gateway with task submission endpoint (depends on 2)."

### 4. Potential Challenges & Proposed Solutions
-   Identify at least 3 significant challenges in building such a system (e.g., distributed consensus, state management, eventual consistency).
-   Propose high-level solutions or strategies for addressing these challenges.

### 5. Innovation & Unique Selling Points
-   Suggest any innovative features or approaches that would make this DTSS stand out.

We look forward to your detailed and ambitious design!
