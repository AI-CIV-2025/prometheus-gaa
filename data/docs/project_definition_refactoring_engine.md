# Project Definition: Advanced AI-Powered Code Refactoring Engine

## Project Title
Advanced AI-Powered Code Refactoring Engine (ARC-Engine)

## Goal
To develop a sophisticated, language-agnostic code refactoring engine capable of performing complex code transformations, optimizing code structure, and improving maintainability based on predefined rules and AI-driven insights. The engine should support a plugin-based architecture for extensibility.

## Key Features
1.  **Language Agnostic Core**: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing and manipulation capabilities, initially targeting Python, with clear extension points for other languages.
2.  **Rule-Based Refactoring**: Implement a mechanism for defining and applying refactoring rules (e.g., extract method, rename variable, introduce parameter object, simplify conditional).
3.  **Static Analysis Integration**: Ability to integrate with static analysis tools to identify refactoring opportunities and validate transformations.
4.  **Test Generation/Adaptation**: Automatically generate or adapt unit tests to ensure code correctness after refactoring.
5.  **Interactive CLI**: A command-line interface for applying refactorings, previewing changes, and managing rules.
6.  **Extensible Plugin System**: Allow users to define and integrate custom refactoring rules and language support.

## Architectural Considerations
*   **Modular Design**: Separate concerns for parsing, analysis, transformation, and output.
*   **Plugin-Based**: Core engine provides APIs for adding new languages and refactoring rules.
*   **AST-Centric**: All transformations operate on an AST representation of the code.
*   **Idempotency**: Refactoring operations should ideally be idempotent where applicable.
*   **Version Control Integration**: Ability to work with source control systems (e.g., Git) for diffing and committing changes.

## Expected Outcomes
*   A robust, well-documented codebase for the ARC-Engine.
*   A set of initial refactoring rules for Python.
*   Comprehensive unit and integration tests.
*   Detailed architectural and user documentation.
*   A functional CLI tool demonstrating core capabilities.
