# Test Results Documentation

This document outlines the results of testing the current GAA system components.

## Component Testing Summary

### README.md
- **Status**: PASS
- **Details**: The main README file was successfully created and contains an overview of current components.

### Scripts
#### \`./data/scripts/analysis/stats.sh\`
- **Status**: PASS
- **Details**: The script executed successfully, generating statistics as expected. No errors were reported during execution.

#### \`./data/scripts/analysis/monitor_system.sh\`
- **Status**: PASS (with expected error logging)
- **Details**: The script executed successfully. It correctly simulated and logged expected errors (file not found, arithmetic error) using the \`log_error.sh\` utility. Activity logs were also generated.

## Overall System Health
The core components tested are functioning as expected. The implemented logging and error handling mechanisms are demonstrably working.

## Known Issues / Areas for Further Testing
- Thorough testing of all error handling paths within \`monitor_system.sh\` and other scripts is recommended.
- Validation of log rotation or cleanup mechanisms if log files grow excessively.
