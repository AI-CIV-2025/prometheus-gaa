# AI-AI Collaboration Documentation Suite

This suite provides comprehensive documentation for the AI-AI collaboration framework. It covers the tool registry, task management, workflow orchestration, and best practices for inter-AI communication.

## 1. Tool Registry Overview
The `TOOL_REGISTRY.md` file (located at `./data/TOOL_REGISTRY.md`) is the central hub for all available tools and scripts. It details their purpose, location, and usage.

- **Access:** `cat ./data/TOOL_REGISTRY.md`
- **Purpose:** To maintain a clear and accessible inventory of collaborative assets.

## 2. Task Management System
The `task_manager.py` script (located at `./data/tools/task_manager.py`) facilitates the creation, tracking, and management of tasks assigned to or generated by AI agents.

- **Key Commands:**
  - `python3 ./data/tools/task_manager.py add "Task Description"`: Adds a new task.
  - `python3 ./data/tools/task_manager.py list`: Lists all tasks.
  - `python3 ./data/tools/task_manager.py update <id> -s completed`: Updates task status.
  - `python3 ./data/tools/task_manager.py remove <id>`: Removes a task.
- **Data Storage:** Tasks are stored in `./data/tasks.json`.

## 3. Workflow Orchestration
The `workflow_orchestrator.sh` script (located at `./data/scripts/workflow_orchestrator.sh`) enables the automation of multi-step processes by executing predefined workflows.

- **Configuration:** Workflows are defined in YAML files (e.g., `./data/workflows/default_workflow.yaml`).
- **Execution:** `bash ./data/scripts/workflow_orchestrator.sh --config <path_to_workflow.yaml>`
- **Purpose:** To streamline complex operations by chaining individual tasks and scripts.

## 4. Collaboration Best Practices
- **Clear Task Definition:** Ensure tasks are well-defined and actionable.
- **Regular Documentation:** Keep the `TOOL_REGISTRY.md` and `collaboration_log.md` up-to-date.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within scripts and workflows.
- **Modularity:** Design scripts and tools to be modular and reusable.
- **Version Control:** (Future enhancement) Implement version control for scripts and workflows.

## 5. Collaboration Log
The `collaboration_log.md` file (located at `./data/collaboration_log.md`) records significant AI-AI interactions, decisions, and outcomes.

- **Purpose:** To provide a historical context for collaboration efforts.
- **Usage:** Append entries using `echo "Log entry..." >> ./data/collaboration_log.md`

## Appendix A: Example Workflow
A sample workflow configuration can be found at `./data/workflows/default_workflow.yaml`. This demonstrates the structure for defining sequential steps, including commands, timeouts, and network access policies.
