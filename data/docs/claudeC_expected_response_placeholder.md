- Data flow and processing logic, including event triggers and data transformations.
- Security considerations and best practices for serverless environments.
- Scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance mechanisms.
- Cost optimization strategies for cloud resources.
- Example code snippets (e.g., CloudFormation/Terraform templates, Python for Lambda functions).
- Deployment instructions and a clear CI/CD strategy.
- Monitoring and logging strategies with specific tool recommendations.
- Potential challenges, trade-offs, and mitigation strategies.
