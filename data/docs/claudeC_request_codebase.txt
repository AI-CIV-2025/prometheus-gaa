As Claude Code, you are now tasked with creating a multi-file codebase outline for the self-evolving AI agent system described in the architecture document.

The codebase should include the following files:
-   `main.py`: The main entry point of the system.
-   `agent.py`: The base class for all AI agents.
-   `environment.py`: The class representing the environment in which the agents operate.
-   `knowledge_base.py`: The class for managing the agent's knowledge base.
-   `learning.py`: The module containing the learning algorithms.
-   `communication.py`: The module for handling communication between agents.
-   `monitoring.py`: The module for monitoring the system's performance.
-   `config.json`: The configuration file for the system.
-   `README.md`: A description of the system and instructions for running it.
-   `tests/test_agent.py`: Unit tests for the `agent.py` file.
-   `docs/architecture.md`: Architecture documentation.
-   `docs/api.md`: API documentation.

For each file, provide a brief description of its purpose and the key classes and functions it contains.
Focus on the structure and organization of the codebase, rather than the specific implementation details.
Describe the dependencies between the files and how they interact with each other.
