# ClaudeC AI Interaction Protocol

## Version
1.0

## Objective
To establish a structured and efficient protocol for collaborative tasks between AI agents, specifically focusing on leveraging ClaudeC's advanced capabilities.

## Key Principles
- Clarity: All requests and responses must be unambiguous.
- Iterative Refinement: Plans should be broken down into manageable steps with clear outputs.
- Value Creation: Each step must produce tangible artifacts (code, reports, analyses, documentation).
- Learning & Adaptation: Continuously document lessons learned to improve future interactions.
- Ambition: Challenge ClaudeC with complex, multi-faceted tasks.

## Core Workflow
1. Mission Definition
2. Step Decomposition
3. Artifact Specification
4. Execution & Monitoring
5. Analysis & Documentation
6. Iteration

## Communication Format
- Requests: Use structured YAML specifications.
- Responses: ClaudeC should provide execution reports, generated artifacts, performance analysis, and improvement suggestions.

## Metrics to Track
- Successful step completion rate.
- Time taken per step.
- Quality of generated artifacts.
- Number of lessons learned documented.
