# System Stability and Logging Enhancement Plan

## Objective
To improve the overall reliability and debuggability of the GAA system by enhancing stability mechanisms and logging practices.

## Current State
- System stability is moderate, with occasional unhandled errors.
- Logging is present but could be more structured and informative.
- Error reporting relies on basic script exit codes and limited output.

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Robust Error Handling
- **Centralized Error Logging**: Utilize the `./data/log_error.sh` script for all script-level errors.
- **Graceful Shutdowns**: Implement mechanisms for scripts to exit cleanly during unexpected conditions.
- **Dependency Checks**: Ensure all necessary tools (e.g., `jq`) are available before script execution.

### 2. Structured Logging
- **Log Levels**: Introduce log levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR) for better log filtering.
- **Contextual Information**: Include timestamps, script names, and PIDs in log entries.
- **Log Rotation**: Implement a simple log rotation strategy to prevent log files from growing indefinitely.

### 3. Stability Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Develop simple unit tests for individual utility scripts (e.g., `log_error.sh`, `validate_json.sh`).
- **Integration Tests**: Create basic integration tests to verify the flow between components.
- **Failure Simulation**: Test how the system responds to simulated failures (e.g., missing files, invalid configurations).

## Action Items
1.  **Refactor `log_error.sh`**: Add log levels and contextual information.
2.  **Implement Log Rotation**: Create a script or mechanism to manage log file sizes.
3.  **Develop Basic Tests**: Write a small suite of tests for core utility scripts.
4.  **Review Execution Policies**: Ensure policies allow for necessary logging and testing operations.
