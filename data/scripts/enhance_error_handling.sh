echo "This script is a placeholder. To enhance error handling and logging:"
echo "1. Review existing scripts for inadequate error checks (e.g., checking command exit codes)."
echo "2. Implement consistent logging formats (e.g., including timestamps, severity levels)."
echo "3. Add specific error handling for potential failure points (e.g., file not found, network issues)."
echo "Example: Adding error checking to a command:"
echo "# command_that_might_fail || echo \"ERROR: command_that_might_fail failed.\" >> ${EXECUTION_PATH}/error.log"
echo ""
echo "Please specify areas where error handling or logging needs improvement."
