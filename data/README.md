# GAA System Documentation

## Overview
The GAA system is designed for autonomous task execution and learning. This document outlines the system's current capabilities, limitations, and areas for improvement.

## Current Capabilities
- File system operations (creation, modification, analysis) within the ./data directory.
- Limited command execution as defined by the system policy.
- Generation of reports and documentation.
- Delegation of complex tasks to Claude via #TASK directives.

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **YAML Parsing:**  Current system policy restricts YAML parsing.
- **API Efficiency:**  API interactions are not optimized.
- **Error Handling:**  Error handling is rudimentary and needs improvement.
- **Network Access:**  Network access is restricted, limiting external data retrieval.
- **Execution Policy:**  The execution policy limits the range of executable commands.
- **Component Validation:** Direct execution of generated scripts is often blocked by policy.
- **No External Dependencies:** Cannot rely on external libraries or network resources.

## Areas for Improvement
- Enhanced documentation (this document).
- Improved error handling and logging.
- Streamlined task execution flow.
- Leveraging Claude for code generation and analysis tasks.

## Usage
Refer to the individual component documentation for specific usage instructions.
