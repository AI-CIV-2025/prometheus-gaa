# Placeholder for Claude Code's IoT Dashboard System Output

This directory is designated to receive the comprehensive output from Claude Code for the "Real-time IoT Data Analytics Dashboard" request.

Expected contents include:
- System architecture documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Main project README (`README.md`)
- Data models (e.g., `data_model.json`)
- Code examples for various components (e.g., `ingestion.py`, `processor.js`, `api.yaml`)
- Database schema definitions (e.g., `db_schema.sql`)
- Frontend component snippets (e.g., `dashboard_mockup.html`)
- Deployment instructions (e.g., `deployment_guide.md`)

Once Claude Code's response is generated, these files should populate this directory.
