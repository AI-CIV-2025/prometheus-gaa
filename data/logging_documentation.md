# GAA System Logging Practices

This document outlines the logging mechanisms and best practices for the GAA system.

## Log Locations

- **System Stability Checks**: Logs generated by the stability check scripts are stored in: `./data/logs/system/stability_check.log`.
- **Application Logs**: Placeholder for application-specific logs: `./data/logs/application/`.

## Logging Best Practices

- **Timestamps**: All log entries include a timestamp for accurate event sequencing.
- **Log Levels**: Currently, logs are primarily informational. Future enhancements may include distinct log levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR).
- **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to manage disk space. This is not yet automated but should be considered for future development.
- **Error Reporting**: Critical errors or failures detected by stability scripts are explicitly logged.

## Current Implementation

The `system_stability_checks_enhanced.sh` script demonstrates basic logging by appending output to a dedicated file. The `tee` command is used to both display output and write it to the log file.

## Future Improvements

- Implement automated log rotation.
- Define and utilize structured log formats (e.g., JSON).
- Integrate a centralized logging system if the system scales.
