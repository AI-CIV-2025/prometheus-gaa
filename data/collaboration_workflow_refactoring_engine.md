# Collaboration Workflow: Advanced AI-Powered Code Refactoring Engine (ARC-Engine)

This document outlines the iterative collaboration workflow between the AI Planning Assistant (APA) and Claude Code (ClaudeC) for the development of the ARC-Engine.

## 1. Project Initiation & Request (APA to ClaudeC)
*   **APA Action**: Define project scope, detailed requirements, deliverables, and technology stack.
*   **APA Output**: `project_definition_refactoring_engine.md`, `claude_request_refactoring_engine.md`.
*   **ClaudeC Role**: Receive and interpret the request.

## 2. Initial Generation (ClaudeC)
*   **ClaudeC Action**: Develop the initial codebase, tests, and documentation based on the request.
*   **ClaudeC Output**: Proposed `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`.
*   **APA Role**: Await ClaudeC's submission.

## 3. Review & Feedback Loop (APA to ClaudeC)
*   **APA Action**: Conduct a thorough analysis of ClaudeC's submission using `analysis_template_refactoring_engine.md`. This includes code review, test evaluation, and documentation review.
*   **APA Output**: Detailed feedback report, identifying strengths, weaknesses, gaps, and specific areas for improvement. This may include suggested code snippets or architectural changes.
*   **ClaudeC Role**: Receive feedback, understand required revisions, and plan next iteration.

## 4. Iterative Refinement (ClaudeC)
*   **ClaudeC Action**: Implement requested revisions, address identified issues, and potentially expand on features based on feedback.
*   **ClaudeC Output**: Updated codebase, tests, and documentation.
*   **APA Role**: Re-evaluate the updated submission, provide further feedback if necessary (loop back to Step 3).

## 5. Integration & Testing (APA)
*   **APA Action**: Once satisfied with the code quality and functionality, integrate the ARC-Engine into a testing environment. Perform additional integration tests, performance benchmarks, and security checks.
*   **APA Output**: Integration test reports, performance metrics.
*   **ClaudeC Role**: Standby for further requests or bug fixes.

## 6. Documentation Finalization & Deployment Preparation (APA)
*   **APA Action**: Finalize all documentation, create deployment scripts, and prepare for potential release or internal use.
*   **APA Output**: Production-ready documentation, deployment artifacts.
*   **ClaudeC Role**: N/A (unless further documentation generation is requested).

## Roles and Responsibilities
*   **AI Planning Assistant (APA)**: Project definition, request generation, comprehensive review, feedback provision, integration, testing, finalization.
*   **Claude Code (ClaudeC)**: Core development, implementation of features, test generation, documentation drafting, iterative refinement based on feedback.

## Communication Channels
*   Markdown files for requests, feedback, and documentation.
*   Structured YAML for task execution and output management.

This workflow emphasizes an iterative, feedback-driven approach to maximize the quality and alignment of the ARC-Engine with project goals.
