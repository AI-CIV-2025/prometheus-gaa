# GAA System Improvement Plan

This document outlines a plan for improving the GAA system, addressing known issues and enhancing functionality based on the core mission.

## 1. Code Organization and Documentation
- **Objective**: Ensure code is well-organized and documented.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create logical subdirectories for different script types (e.g., `scripts/analysis`, `scripts/utils`).
  - Add detailed comments to all scripts explaining their purpose and functionality.
  - Maintain and update `README.md` to reflect current components.
  - Generate `code_inventory.md` regularly to track files.
- **Status**: Initial inventory created. Further organization pending policy review for `mkdir`.

## 2. Fixing Known Issues
- **Objective**: Address identified issues in YAML parsing, API efficiency, and error handling.
- **Tasks**:
  - **YAML Parsing**: Identify specific YAML files and the parsing logic. Use `yq` if permitted, or `python3` with a YAML library if allowed.
  - **API Efficiency**: Analyze API calls (if any are present and permitted) for performance bottlenecks. Implement caching or batching where appropriate.
  - **Error Handling**: Review scripts for robust error handling (e.g., checking command exit codes, using `set -e` or `trap`).
- **Status**: Issues identified, specific solutions require further investigation and policy confirmation.

## 3. System Stability and Logging
- **Objective**: Enhance system reliability and provide better insights through logging.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement comprehensive logging for all script executions, capturing inputs, outputs, and errors.
  - Centralize logs for easier monitoring.
  - Use `tee` to write logs to both stdout and files for immediate feedback and persistent records.
  - Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory) using available tools.
- **Status**: Basic logging implemented with `collect_stats.sh`. Expansion planned.

## 4. Testing and Documentation of Functionality
- **Objective**: Clearly document what works and what doesn't.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a `test_suite.sh` script that executes core functionalities and verifies outputs.
  - Document the results of these tests.
  - Use `set -e` in scripts to ensure immediate exit on error.
- **Status**: Planning phase. Test suite creation to follow.

## 5. Simple, Achievable Improvements
- **Objective**: Implement small, impactful changes.
- **Tasks**:
  - Refine existing scripts for clarity and efficiency within policy constraints.
  - Automate routine tasks where possible.
  - Explore using `python3` for more complex file manipulations if permitted.
- **Status**: Ongoing.

## Next Steps for this Plan:
1. **Policy Review**: Explicitly confirm permissions for `mkdir`, `python3`, and specific utilities like `yq`.
2. **Refine `collect_stats.sh`**: Add more detailed system metrics if possible.
3. **Develop `test_suite.sh`**: Start creating basic tests for existing scripts.
