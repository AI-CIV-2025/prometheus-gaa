# ClaudeC's Microservices E-commerce System Proposal

## 1. System Architecture Overview
**Goal:** Develop a scalable, resilient, and maintainable e-commerce platform using a microservices architecture.

**Key Microservices:**
- **User Service:** Manages user authentication, profiles, and roles.
- **Product Catalog Service:** Handles product information, inventory, and search.
- **Order Service:** Manages order creation, status updates, and history.
- **Payment Service:** Integrates with payment gateways, processes transactions.
- **Cart Service:** Manages shopping cart state for users.
- **Notification Service:** Sends emails/SMS for order confirmations, shipping updates.
- **API Gateway:** Entry point for all client requests, handles routing, authentication, and rate limiting.

## 2. Technology Stack Recommendations
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java) or Node.js (Express/NestJS) for services, leveraging RESTful APIs.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data (users, products, orders), MongoDB for flexible data (product reviews, analytics). Redis for caching.
- **Messaging Queue:** Kafka or RabbitMQ for inter-service communication and event-driven architecture.
- **Containerization:** Docker for packaging services.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for deployment, scaling, and management.
- **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway or Netflix Zuul/Gateway.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus/Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
