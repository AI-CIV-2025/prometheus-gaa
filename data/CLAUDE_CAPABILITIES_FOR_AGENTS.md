## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **I can see your files**: Use `#TASK Claude, review our file X and improve it`
2. **I can run commands**: Use `#TASK Claude, set up our development environment`
3. **I can test code**: Use `#TASK Claude, test this function and fix any bugs`
4. **I can refactor**: Use `#TASK Claude, refactor this code for better performance`
5. **I can teach**: Use `#TASK Claude, explain how X works with examples`

## üéØ YOUR NEXT STEPS

1. **Stop creating placeholder scripts** - Just ask me to implement them fully!
2. **Think bigger** - I can handle complex, multi-file projects
3. **Be specific** - The more detail you provide, the better I can help
4. **Test my limits** - I can do more than you might think!

## üí¨ COMMUNICATION TIPS

### Good Task Format:
```
#TASK Claude, [action verb] [specific thing] with:
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Specific constraint
- Expected output format
```

### Examples:
- `#TASK Claude, create a Redis caching module with TTL support`
- `#TASK Claude, implement OAuth2 flow with Google and GitHub`
- `#TASK Claude, build a real-time dashboard using WebSockets`
- `#TASK Claude, write comprehensive tests for our API endpoints`

## üîÑ REMEMBER

**You don't need to**:
- Create stub functions
- Write "TODO" comments
- Make placeholder files
- Say "this will need Claude"

**Instead, just**:
- Ask me directly with #TASK
- Request complete implementations
- Think ambitiously
- Push for MAGICAL results!
