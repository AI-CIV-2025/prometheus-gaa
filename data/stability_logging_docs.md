# System Stability and Logging Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document details strategies for enhancing the overall stability and logging capabilities of the GAA system.

## Stability Improvements
1.  **Resource Management:** Implement checks and balances for resource utilization (CPU, memory) to prevent system overload.
2.  **Dependency Management:** Ensure all system dependencies are clearly defined and managed.
3.  **Graceful Degradation:** Design components to degrade gracefully when encountering errors or unavailable resources, rather than failing completely.
4.  **Configuration Management:** Centralize and validate system configurations to prevent runtime errors.
5.  **Regular Audits:** Schedule periodic reviews of system performance and error logs.

## Logging Improvements
1.  **Structured Logging:** Adopt a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) for easier parsing and analysis.
2.  **Log Levels:** Implement distinct log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL) to categorize messages effectively.
3.  **Centralized Logging:** If feasible, integrate with a centralized logging system for aggregated log management.
4.  **Contextual Information:** Ensure log messages include relevant context, such as timestamps, process IDs, and module names.
5.  **Log Rotation and Retention:** Implement log rotation policies to manage disk space and define log retention periods.

## Proposed Actions (Requires Agent Assistance or Policy Change)
- `#TASK Claude, implement structured logging with appropriate log levels for all system components.`
- `#TASK Claude, develop a mechanism for monitoring resource utilization and triggering alerts.`
- `#TASK Claude, create a system for managing and validating configuration files.`

## Current Status
These are areas identified for improvement. The system will focus on documenting these points and preparing for their implementation.
