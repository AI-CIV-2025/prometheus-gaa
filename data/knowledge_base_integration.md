# AI Collaboration Incident Response Knowledge Base Integration

This document describes how the newly created incident response plan will be integrated with the existing AI Collaboration Knowledge Base.

## 1. Knowledge Base Structure Update
*   Add a new section to the knowledge base dedicated to "Incident Response".
*   Create sub-sections for:
    *   Incident Types
    *   Incident Response Workflow
    *   Roles and Responsibilities
    *   Communication Protocols
    *   Escalation Procedures
    *   Post-Incident Reports

## 2. Content Migration
*   Copy the content from the following files into the corresponding knowledge base sub-sections:
    *   ./data/ai_collaboration_incident_types.md -> Knowledge Base: Incident Response/Incident Types
    *   ./data/ai_collaboration_incident_workflow.md -> Knowledge Base: Incident Response/Incident Response Workflow
    *   ./data/ai_collaboration_incident_roles.md -> Knowledge Base: Incident Response/Roles and Responsibilities
    *   ./data/ai_collaboration_communication_protocols.md -> Knowledge Base: Incident Response/Communication Protocols
    *   ./data/ai_collaboration_escalation_procedures.md -> Knowledge Base: Incident Response/Escalation Procedures
    *   ./data/ai_collaboration_post_incident_report_template.md -> Knowledge Base: Incident Response/Post-Incident Reports

## 3. Linking and Cross-Referencing
*   Create links between related sections of the knowledge base. For example:
    *   Link from the "Incident Types" section to the "Incident Response Workflow" section, explaining how each incident type should be handled.
    *   Link from the "Roles and Responsibilities" section to the "Incident Response Workflow" section, showing which roles are responsible for each step.
*   Add cross-references to relevant external resources, such as security best practices, legal regulations, and AI ethics guidelines.

## 4. Search and Indexing
*   Ensure that the new content is properly indexed by the knowledge base search engine.
*   Add relevant keywords and tags to the content to improve searchability.

## 5. Training and Awareness
*   Provide training to all relevant personnel on the new incident response plan and how to access it through the knowledge base.
*   Promote awareness of the new plan and knowledge base content through internal communication channels.

## 6. Example Integration Steps

Assuming the knowledge base is a Markdown file:

1.  **Create the "Incident Response" Section:**
