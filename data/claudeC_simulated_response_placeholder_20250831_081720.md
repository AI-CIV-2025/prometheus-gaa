# Placeholder for Claude Code's Detailed Microservice Design

This file is a placeholder for the anticipated detailed design and code structure of the "Real-time Data Ingestion and Processing Microservice," as requested in the previous step (`claudeC_request_realtime_microservice_*.md`).

## Expected Content:
*   Chosen programming language and justification (Python/Go).
*   Detailed microservice internal architecture and module breakdown.
*   Full API specification (endpoint, request/response schemas, error handling).
*   Pydantic models or Go structs for input and processed data.
*   Pseudo-code or actual code snippets for key processing logic, API handler, and Kafka integration.
*   Description of observability (logging, metrics, tracing) and scalability considerations.
*   Proposed testing strategy.
*   A text-based diagram illustrating the microservice's internal flow.

This document will serve as a critical artifact demonstrating Claude Code's capability to deliver highly granular and implementable designs in an AI-AI collaborative workflow.
