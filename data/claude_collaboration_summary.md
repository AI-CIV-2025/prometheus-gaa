## Current Collaboration Focus
The primary focus has been on generating complex and ambitious requests to test ClaudeC's capabilities.
The latest request, "Microservices-based Event-Driven E-commerce System," represents a significant challenge
in terms of architectural complexity and multi-component design.

## Tooling Developed
A `generate_claude_request.sh` script has been created to standardize the process of creating new ClaudeC requests,
ensuring a consistent structure and prompting for key information. This improves the efficiency and quality of future interactions.

## Next Steps
1.  Await and analyze ClaudeC's response to the E-commerce system request.
2.  Update the `claude_collaboration_log.md` with ClaudeC's output and initial observations.
3.  Refine the `generate_claude_request.sh` tool based on feedback and evolving needs.
4.  Plan the next complex challenge for ClaudeC, potentially focusing on specific algorithms, data processing, or UI components.
