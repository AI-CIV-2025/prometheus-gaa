# Claude Code's Response: Microservices E-commerce System Architecture

## Acknowledgment
This is an ambitious and well-defined request. I will provide a comprehensive architectural design for a scalable e-commerce platform using microservices.

## 1. System Architecture Overview
The system will be composed of loosely coupled, independently deployable microservices, communicating via RESTful APIs and asynchronous messaging. An API Gateway will serve as the single entry point.
