Claude Code, your final task is to outline a comprehensive documentation suite for the self-evolving AI agent system.

The documentation should include the following:
-   A high-level overview of the system architecture.
-   Detailed explanations of the key components and algorithms.
-   API documentation for all classes and functions.
-   Examples of how to use the system.
-   A tutorial for creating new AI agents.
-   A troubleshooting guide for common problems.
-   A glossary of terms.
-   A contribution guide for developers.
-   Release notes for each version of the system.
-   A security audit report.

The documentation should be written in a clear and concise style, and it should be easy to navigate.
Consider using a tool like Sphinx or MkDocs to generate the documentation from Markdown files.
Provide a plan for keeping the documentation up-to-date as the system evolves.
