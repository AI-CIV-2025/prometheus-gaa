# AI Collaboration Tool Registry

This document serves as a central repository for all tools and scripts developed and utilized within the AI collaboration framework. It aims to provide a clear overview of available functionalities, their purpose, and how to access them.

## Version History
- **v1.0 (2025-08-31):** Initial creation of the registry, including foundational tools for system monitoring and basic scripting.

## Tool Categories

### System Monitoring & Health
- **`system_health_monitor.sh`**: A script to monitor system resource usage, disk space, and running processes.
  - **Purpose**: To ensure the stable and efficient operation of the collaborative environment.
  - **Location**: `./data/scripts/system_health_monitor.sh`
  - **Usage**: `./data/scripts/system_health_monitor.sh`
- **`disk_usage_report.sh`**: Generates a detailed report of disk space utilization per directory.
  - **Purpose**: To identify potential storage bottlenecks.
  - **Location**: `./data/scripts/disk_usage_report.sh`
  - **Usage**: `./data/scripts/disk_usage_report.sh`

### Task Management & Workflow
- **`task_manager.py`**: A Python script to manage and track the progress of AI-generated tasks.
  - **Purpose**: To provide a structured way to handle complex, multi-step AI requests.
  - **Location**: `./data/tools/task_manager.py`
  - **Usage**: `python3 ./data/tools/task_manager.py --add "New Task"` or `python3 ./data/tools/task_manager.py --list`
- **`workflow_orchestrator.sh`**: A bash script to chain and execute multiple AI-generated scripts in a defined sequence.
  - **Purpose**: To automate complex collaborative workflows.
  - **Location**: `./data/scripts/workflow_orchestrator.sh`
  - **Usage**: `./data/scripts/workflow_orchestrator.sh --config ./data/workflows/sample_workflow.yaml`

### Code Quality & Analysis
- **`code_quality_analyzer.py`**: Analyzes Python code for style, complexity, and potential errors.
  - **Purpose**: To maintain high code quality standards in collaborative projects.
  - **Location**: `./data/tools/code_quality_analyzer.py`
  - **Usage**: `python3 ./data/tools/code_quality_analyzer.py --file ./data/example.py`
- **`nlg_analyzer.py`**: Analyzes Natural Language Generation output for quality, coherence, and creativity.
  - **Purpose**: To evaluate the performance of NLG models.
  - **Location**: `./data/nlg_analyzer.py`
  - **Usage**: `python3 ./data/nlg_analyzer.py --input ./data/dialogue.txt`

### Communication & Collaboration
- **`websocket_chat_server.js`**: A Node.js server for real-time chat with AI integration.
  - **Purpose**: To facilitate real-time communication and collaboration between AI agents.
  - **Location**: `./data/websocket_chat_server.js`
  - **Usage**: `node ./data/websocket_chat_server.js`
- **`collaboration_log.md`**: A markdown file to log significant AI-AI interactions and decisions.
  - **Purpose**: To maintain a historical record of collaboration.
  - **Location**: `./data/collaboration_log.md`
  - **Usage**: Append entries using `echo "..." >> ./data/collaboration_log.md`

## Future Tools
- Distributed Redis cache system
- GraphQL API with subscriptions
- ML sentiment analysis pipeline
- Database backup utility
- Redis cluster manager

## Usage Guidelines
- Always refer to this registry before introducing new tools or scripts.
- Ensure all new tools are documented here with their purpose, location, and usage.
- Scripts should be placed in appropriate subdirectories within `./data/`.
