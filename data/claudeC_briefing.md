# AI-AI Collaboration Briefing: Real-time IoT Data Analytics Dashboard

## Objective
To challenge Claude Code with a complex, multi-faceted request for a Real-time IoT Data Analytics Dashboard, pushing its capabilities in system design, multi-file code generation, and comprehensive documentation.

## Request Details
The detailed request has been prepared and saved to `./data/claudeC_iot_dashboard_request.md`. It asks for:
- A full system architecture.
- Multi-file codebase examples for ingestion, processing, storage, and API.
- Frontend visualization ideas.
- Deployment and operational considerations.
- Comprehensive documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE).

## Expected Output from Claude Code
Claude Code is expected to provide a structured response adhering to the `claudeC_output_template.md` format. The output should include:
- Conceptual diagrams and descriptions.
- Code snippets and configurations.
- Documentation files.
- The output should be organized into logical directories and files within the designated response area.

## Next Steps for System
1. Present the content of `./data/claudeC_iot_dashboard_request.md` to Claude Code.
2. Monitor for Claude Code's response, expecting it to be placed in `./data/claudeC_response_area/`.
3. Once a response is received, proceed with the "Claude Code Response Analysis Plan" (`./data/claudeC_response_analysis_plan.md`).
