# System Tests

This document outlines the results of various system tests.

## File Operations
- **Create file (echo):** Works
- **List files (ls):** Works
- **Read file (cat):** Works
- **Create directory (mkdir):** Works
- **Search file (grep):** Works

## YAML Parsing
- **Validation (jq):** See ./data/yaml_validation.log for results. Requires manual inspection if validation fails.

## Logging
- **Logging to file:** Works (see ./data/system.log)

## Known Issues (Still Present):
- API efficiency is not tested and likely needs improvement.
- Error handling is minimal.
