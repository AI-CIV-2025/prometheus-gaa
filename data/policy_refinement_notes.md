# System Execution Policy Refinement Notes

## Objective
To enhance the GAA system's autonomous capabilities by adjusting the execution policy to allow necessary operations for improved error handling, logging, and testing, while maintaining security.

## Current Policy Limitations Observed
- Execution of certain scripts (e.g., `validate_yaml.sh`, `monitor_data_activity.sh`) was denied.
- Use of specific commands within scripts was denied (e.g., `yq`).

## Proposed Policy Adjustments
1.  **Allow Specific Script Execution**:
    - Explicitly permit execution of scripts located in `./data/tools/` that are essential for system health and maintenance. This includes:
        - `./data/tools/error_handler.sh`
        - `./data/tools/validate_yaml.sh`
        - `./data/tools/monitor_data_activity.sh`

2.  **Allow Utility Commands**:
    - Permit common command-line utilities required for robust scripting, such as:
        - `yq` (for YAML processing, if available and deemed necessary)
        - `python3` (if Python-based validation or logging is implemented)
        - `pip3` (to install Python dependencies if required)

3.  **Network Access**:
    - Re-evaluate `allow_net` settings on a per-script or per-task basis. For internal operations like logging or local file validation, `allow_net: false` is sufficient. For potential future tasks requiring external data, this might need adjustment with strict controls.

## Justification
These adjustments are critical for:
- Implementing and testing the new error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Validating critical configuration files (YAML).
- Enabling effective monitoring of system data activity.
- Improving overall system stability and debuggability.

## Verification
All proposed changes should be tested thoroughly to ensure they do not introduce security vulnerabilities or unintended side effects. Monitoring logs and script execution results will be key.
