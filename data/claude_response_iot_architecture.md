# IoT Anomaly Detection System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive IoT anomaly detection system. The system comprises several key components: Sensor Data Generation, Data Preprocessing, Anomaly Detection Model Training, Real-time Anomaly Analysis, and Alerting.

## 1. Sensor Data Generation
- **Purpose:** Simulate realistic sensor data for testing and training.
- **Components:** Python-based data generators for temperature, pressure, humidity, and vibration sensors.
- **Data Format:** JSON with timestamps and sensor readings.
- **Example:**
